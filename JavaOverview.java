/**
 * Assignment that provides an overview of basic features
 * of the Java programming language.
 *
 * This code will be executed by running the following commands from the console:
 * javac JavaOverview.java
 * java JavaOverview      
 * 
 * See instructions in the README on how to run unit tests from the command line.
 * You can also run JavaOverviewTest.java as a JUnit5 test in Eclipse.
 *
 * I recommend using either Eclipse or GitHub codespaces to work on this code. 
 * If you use Eclipse, make sure the unit tests from the command line
 * execute successfully before submitting.
 * 
 * You are expected to complete all exercises according
 * to the specifications. Do not change the names or headers
 * for any existing methods. You may add new methods, and
 * will specifically be required to for some exercises.        
 * All methods that you create should have public access.
 * Absolutely all methods in this file must have complete
 * Javadoc style header comments with all appropriate tags,
 * such as return and param, filled out. Additional documentation
 * is required within method bodies as appropriate. Some
 * method stubs currently return a dummy result to allow
 * compilation, but you will need to replace these with
 * proper return values. Whenever console output is required,        
 * all formatting must match the specification exactly.
